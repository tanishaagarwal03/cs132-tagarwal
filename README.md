# CS 132 - Web Development Projects

## Overview
This repository contains all the coursework for CS 132: Web Development, Fall 2024. The projects and homework assignments in this repository focus on building skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leading up to full-stack development. Each directory in this repository is dedicated to a specific Creative Project (CP) or Homework (HW), and includes all related files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any necessary assets.

## Directory Structure
- `cp1/` - Contains all files for Creative Project 1 (CP1), including HTML, CSS, and wireframes.
- `hwX/` - Homework assignments (to be added as we progress in the course).

## Creative Project 1 (CP1) - "Exploring Edinburgh"
For CP1, the project focuses on creating a multi-page website titled **"Exploring Edinburgh"**, which highlights key attractions, cafes, restaurants, nightlife spots, and general tips for navigating the city of Edinburgh. The website is built using HTML and CSS, emphasizing good web design principles like responsiveness, accessibility and adhering to semantics.

### Wireframes:
The directory `cp1/` also contains a PDF file named `wireframe.pdf` that outlines the visual structure and layout of each page before implementation. This was incredibly helpful when I was visualising the website and to finally implement it in HTML and CSS.

## Future Work
Future homework assignments and projects will be added to this repository as the course progresses. Each directory will follow a similar structure, ensuring that all files necessary for each project or homework are clearly organized.

## Submission and Testing
All work is submitted through GitHub, and grading is done through CodePost. This repository will be used throughout the course for submission and testing.
