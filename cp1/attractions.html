        <h2>Top 5 Things to Do in Edinburgh</h2>
        <p>
          Edinburgh is so diverse - you can go hiking, do pottery, visit
          bookshops and go to the beach all in the same day. Some popular
          tourist attractions are listed below. Apart from this, don't forget to
          explore the streets of Edinburgh and enter small shops and thirft
          stores which can be hidden gems!

            <p>
              Hike up Arthur's Seat for breathtaking views of the city. It takes
              almost an hour but it is so worth it! You can try the route from
              Holyrood park for an easier way to get up there. Holyrood park
              also has swans and lots of trees and greenery!

            <p>
              Walk down the historic Royal Mile, connecting Edinburgh Castle and
              Holyrood Palace. You should definitely visit Victoria Street as
              well and see all the colourful buildings! You might even find cute
              Harry Potter stores along the way!

            <p>
              Visit the iconic Edinburgh Castle, perched on an extinct volcano.
              You get great views of the city and learn more about the history
              as well! I would also recommend visiting the Ross fountaina and
              the adjoining Princes Gardens as well!

            <p>
              Climb Calton Hill for stunning views and to see the National
              Monument of Scotland. I also saw the Northern Lights on it last
              summer and it was one of the most beautiful sights!
