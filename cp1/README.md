# Creative Project 1 (CP1) - Exploring Edinburgh

## Project Overview
This project, **Exploring Edinburgh**, is the first creative project (CP1) for CS 132: Web Development, Fall 2024. It is a multi-page website that serves as a guide to the city of Edinburgh, highlighting its key attractions, cafes, restaurants, nightlife spots, and general tips for navigating the city. The website uses semantic HTML5 tags and custom CSS to create a visually appealing, accessible, and responsive site.

**Score**: 20/20

**Feedback Highlights**:
- **CSS Factoring**: "Very well done with your CSS factoring! This demonstrates a solid understanding of the separation of concerns between HTML5 and CSS."
- **Semantic HTML**: "Fantastic use of different tags, especially semantic tags!"
- **Page Organization**: "Excellent page organization and use of HTML comments. This will be very useful to refer to for HW1!"
- **Commenting for Colors**: "Great tip to use comments for colors; other web developers will really appreciate working with you :)"
- **Design and Reflection**: "It's clear you are taking away the goals of the material and building a foundation that will be helpful for applying to your interests. You have a natural way of aesthetic design as well (not the focus of the course, but trickier than many think). Very good strategy to talk with a friend as you described, these are great ideas to implement!"

**Instructor Note**: Feedback is provided throughout the files, and your submission exceeded expectations. Thank you for your contributions on Discord and in class!

## Semantic HTML
This project makes use of **semantic HTML5** tags to structure the content in a meaningful way, improving both accessibility and SEO. By focusing on semantics, the site ensures that screen readers and other assistive technologies can interpret the content correctly, contributing to better accessibility for all users.

## Wireframes and DOM Trees
- **Wireframes**: Included in the `wireframe.pdf` file, these visual representations were created during the planning phase to outline the basic layout and design of each page. The wireframes helped ensure a user-friendly interface before moving to code.
- **DOM Tree**: The `dom-tree.pdf` file provides a diagram of the DOM (Document Object Model) structure used for each page. This tree helped guide the HTML implementation, ensuring a well-organized and hierarchical structure for the webpage elements.

## Reflection Document
The `reflection.pdf` file outlines key decisions made during the project, including design challenges, feedback from peers, and iterations.

## Features Implemented
- **Semantic HTML5**: The project uses semantic tags to improve readability and accessibility.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to adapt to different screen sizes using `flexbox` and media queries.
- **Custom CSS Styling**: Each page has unique visual elements while maintaining a consistent overall style across the site.
- **Contact Form**: The contact page includes a form where users can input their name, email, and a message to get in touch.
- **Navigation Bar**: A responsive navigation bar allows easy access to all sections of the website.

## Future Work and Improvements
- **Family-Friendly Section**: I plan to add a subsection to the attractions page that highlights family-friendly activities like museums and parks.
- **Transportation Guide**: Another potential feature is a page dedicated to transportation tips, offering advice on how to get around the city using public transport.
- **Google Map Integration**: Adding Google Map links to locations would make it easier for users to find the venues and attractions mentioned on the website.
