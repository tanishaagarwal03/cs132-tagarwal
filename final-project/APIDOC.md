### **POST** `/checkout`

Processes the entire cart for checkout. This endpoint validates the items in the cart, checks their availability, and calculates the total cost.

---

### **Request Body (JSON)**

The request body must include an array of items.

| Key        | Type   | Required | Description                             |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `name`     | string | Yes      | The name of the potion to purchase.     |
| `quantity` | number | Yes      | The quantity of the potion to purchase. |

---

### **Response**

- **201 Created**: The order was successfully processed.
- **400 Bad Request**:
  - If the cart is empty or not an array.
  - If a potion is not found in the inventory.
  - If a potion is out of stock.

---

### **Workflow Note**

- The cart is managed client-side (e.g., in local storage). When the user proceeds to checkout, the client sends the entire cart (including custom potions) as an array of objects in the request body.
- Custom potions are treated as unique items and should be included in the cart with their name and `quantity` specified.

### **Example Request**

```http
POST /checkout
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    "name": "Potion of Amplified Courage",
    "quantity": 2
  },
  {
    "name": "Potion of Vitality",

The client is responsible for taking this potion data and adding it to their cart logic on the front end.
