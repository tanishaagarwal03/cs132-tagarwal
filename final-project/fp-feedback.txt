Please fill out the following and submit with your Final Project submission (added to help us know what to
focus on when grading, what was intentionally incomplete, etc.):

1. What is your estimated grade for the Final Project (roughly of 100)? For partner projects, do you think the
workload distribution was fair?
I completed both the back-end and front-end development independently, with some helpful guidance from El
during office hours to review and improve my code. Based on the effort I put into meeting the specifications,
implementing additional thoughtful details, and creating comprehensive APIDOC documentation, I would
estimate a grade in the 90s. I believe the project fulfills all the requirements outlined in the spec, and I worked
hard to ensure a polished final product.

2. What is your estimated grade for the course (letter grade)? You can support your estimate with examples of
demonstrated engagement in the course material, strengths (& weaknesses) over the term, and growth
throughout the material (some assignment grading feedback was delayed, but we would like to know what
resources you used to iterate on the material, such as lectures, OH, Discord, etc.)
While I'm not entirely familiar with the grading system for letter grades at Caltech, I would expect a high grade
overall based on my consistent engagement and effort throughout the course.
- Strengths & Growth: I dedicated significant effort to every project, documentation, and code submission.
At the start of the course, I struggled with using flex, needing guidance during OH. By the end, these
concepts felt second nature, and I was able to independently implement layouts and designs. This growth
has been immensely rewarding.
- Engagement: I have tried to actively participate in OH, utilized lectures and cheat sheets as resources, and
continuously iterated on feedback to improve my work. The projects, while challenging, allowed me to
explore creative ideas and strengthen my skills. Building on the projects every week by adding different
aspects to it was rewarding once I saw the finished product.

3. To what extent would you like feedback in your project (e.g. thorough, particular areas of the project, or just a
grade)?
I would appreciate thorough feedback, particularly on areas where I could improve. Suggestions on how to
strengthen specific aspects of my work (e.g., CSS or API design) would be great. Of course, I would also love to
know my grade for the project!

4. Anything else you would like El to know when grading?
I think I have put in 3 all nighters into the project, worked the best I could and I don’t think I could have
honestly done more. Managing both the back-end and front-end on my own was a challenging but rewarding
experience. While I recognize that my CSS could be improved, I believe I did my best given the circumstances
and the workload.

5. Are you open to sharing your project/reflection for future terms? If so, would you like named credit or
anonymous?
Yes, I’m open to sharing my project and reflection. If used, I would prefer named credit.
