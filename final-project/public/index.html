  This is the homepage for my "Mystic Brews" final project.
  The project represents an e-commerce website with a magical theme, inspired by witchcraft
  and mystical potions. The page introduces visitors to the website's features, including:
  - A carousel to showcase products.
  - Sections highlighting available features like pre-made potions, limited edition promotions and brewing custom potions.

  Future Features:
  - JavaScript and custom API integrations for dynamic functionality such as dynamic cart updates visible on homepage, 
    a personalised quiz section, customer service section, FAQ section.
  - Potential addition of animations and enhanced interactivity (e.g., bubbling cauldron).
  - Full integration with backend services for real-time updates with the image carousel.
