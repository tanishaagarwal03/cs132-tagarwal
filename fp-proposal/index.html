  This is the homepage for my "Mystic Brews" final project proposal.
  The project represents an e-commerce website with a magical theme, inspired by witchcraft
  and mystical potions. The page introduces visitors to the website's features, including:
  - A carousel to showcase products.
  - Sections highlighting available features like pre-made potions, holiday promotions, 
    brewing custom potions, a quiz, and customer service.
  - Dynamic elements like an interactive cart icon, which updates as users add items to cart.
  Future Features:
  - JavaScript and custom API integrations for dynamic functionality such as cart management, 
    potion brewing, and personalized quiz results.
  - Potential addition of animations and enhanced interactivity (e.g., bubbling cauldron).
  - Full integration with backend services for real-time updates.
