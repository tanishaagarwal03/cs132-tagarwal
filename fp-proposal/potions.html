  This page showcases a collection of 15 pre-made potions, each with unique names
  and enchanting properties, displayed with images & brief descriptions.

  Planned Features:
  - Each product will dynamically fetch its details (e.g., ingredients, color, price, etc.)
    using an API when clicked. This will redirect users to a detailed product page for the potion.
  - An "Add to Cart" button will be added to each product. Clicking this button
    will dynamically update the cart's contents and the cart icon displayed on all pages.
  - A backend will manage product information, cart updates, and user preferences.
  - The potion descriptions, prices, and other details will load dynamically
    without refreshing the page, improving performance and user experience.
